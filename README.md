# sample-webpage
In this project, I'm going to put to the test my skills in HTML and CSS development.

The webpage is based on the Project "Landing page" from The Odin Project.

My current setup is:
- HP Spectre x360 (Intel i7 8th gen, 8 GB RAM, 1 TB NVMe SSD)
- Windows 11 Pro
- Ubuntu installed in Windows Subsystem for Linux
- Git (Ubuntu)
- Visual Studio Code (Windows 11)
